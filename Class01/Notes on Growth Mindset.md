# Understanding The Growth Mindset
<hr>


Having a ***growth mindset*** to me means having an undefeated mindeset and mentality. Meaning, when things get hard or difficult you don't see it as an 
obstacle you see it as an opprotunity to grow and become better

# Reminders to be in a Growth Mindset 
<hr>

A few ways I will remember to be in the growth mindset when things get difficult are:

> - When **Challenges** arise don't avoid them but embrace them instead. Challenges can be used to make you better and stronger, whether it's physically or 
> mentally
>> - Whenever you're facing an **obstacle** don't lose focus but persist through it. When you continue through an obstacle you are delyaing you're self 
>> instant gratification, which will help you to do some of your best work for a longer period of time.
>>> - A big reminder for myself would defintely be accepting **criticism**. Embracing criticism is very beneficial because seeing something you do from 
>>> someone elses perspective can help you to become better in areas you hadn't thought of. No matter if the criticism is harsh or gentle, always look
>>> at it as a way to improve upon yourself
