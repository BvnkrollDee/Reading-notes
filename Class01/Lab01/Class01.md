Learning about basic syntax and the markdown inputs is very important as it a language that is commonly used and also a bit easier to operate and understand.

## We learned about headings from [Markdown Guide](https://markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)




# Creating Headings
> # Heading level 1

>> ### Heading level 3	
>> #### Heading level 4	
>> ##### Heading level 5	
>> ###### Heading level 6	

# Creating Paragraphs
I really like using Markdown

I think I'll use it to format all of my document from now on.

And, unless the paragraph is included in a list, there is no need to indent the paragraphs with spaces or tabs.

# Line Breaks
This is the first line.

And this is the second line.

# Adding Emphasis & Blockquotes
## Bold text
> Making text **Bold** isn't too complicated
>> neither is *Italicizing* words
>>> making words ***bold and italicized*** is also pretty simple with markdown

# Creating Lists

The article also talks about how to create ordered lists and unordered lists. For example winners of a tournament could be labeled in an ordered list.

### Winners
1. First Place
2. Second place
3. Third place

If you were making a grocery lists however, that wouldn't need to be ordered.

### Today's grocery list
- Eggs
- bread
- Milk 
- Cheese

# Links
Creating links is another simple and effective task that can be done using Markdown inputs.

For example here's a link to [my github]()
