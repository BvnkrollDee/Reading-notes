# ***What is CSS?*** <hr>

**CSS**: (Cascading Style Sheets) a language for specifying how documents are presented to users — how they are styled, laid out, etc.

&nbsp; 

- CSS can be used for very basic document text styling — for example, for changing the color and size of headings and links. It can be used to create a layout — for example, turning a single column of text into a layout with a main content area and a sidebar for related information. It can even be used for effects such as animation.

## **CSS Syntax** <hr>

- CSS is a rule-based language-- you define the rules by specifying groups of styles that should be applied to particular elements or groups of elements on your web page.
