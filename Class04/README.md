## <ins>**What is a wireframe?**</ins> 

&nbsp;

-  Wireframing is a practice used by UX designers which allows them to define and plan the information hierarchy of their design for a website, app, or product. This process focuses on how the designer or client wants the user to process information on a site, based on the user research already performed by the UX design team.

- When designing for the screen you need to know where all the information is going to go in plain black and white diagrams before building anything with code

- Wireframing is also a great way of getting to know how a user interacts with your interface, through the positioning of buttons and menus on the diagrams.

- Without the distractions of colors, typeface choices or text, wireframing lets you plan the layout and interaction of your interface. A commonly-used argument for wireframing is that if a user doesn’t know where to go on a plain hand-drawn diagram of your site page, then it is irrelevant what colors or fancy text eventually get used. A button or call to action needs to be clear to the user even it’s not brightly colored and flashing.

## **Things to Consider Before You Start Wireframing** <hr>

Here are a number of ways different designers can structure the process from design to implementation:

- Wireframe > Interactive Prototype > Visual > Design
- Sketch > Code
- Sketch > Wireframe > Hi-Def Wireframe > Visual > Code
- Sketch > Wireframe > Visual > Code

## **6 Steps to make a Wireframe** <hr>

- *Do your research*
- Prepare your research for quick reference
- Make sure you have your user flow mapped out
-  Draft, don’t draw. Sketch, don’t illustrate
- Add some detail and get testing
- Start turning your wireframes into prototypes

# ***So What is HTML?*** <hr>

- HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content. For example, content could be structured within a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, or using images and data tables. As the title suggests, this article will give you a basic understanding of HTML and its functions.


- HTML is a markup language that defines the structure of your content. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way. The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on.

# ***Semantics*** <hr>

- In programming, Semantics refers to the meaning of a piece of code — for example "what effect does running that line of JavaScript have?", or "what purpose or role does that HTML element have" (rather than "what does it look like?".)

&nbsp;

## <ins>**Semantics in JavaScript**</ins>

- In JavaScript, consider a function that takes a string parameter, and returns an <li> element with that string as its textContent. Would you need to look at the code to understand what the function did if it was called build('Peach'), or createLiWithContent('Peach')

&nbsp;

## <ins>**Semantics in CSS**</ins>

- In CSS, consider styling a list with li elements representing different types of fruits. Would you know what part of the DOM is being selected with div > ul > li, or .fruits__item?

&nbsp;

## <ins>**Semantics in HTML**</ins>

* In HTML, for example, the < h1 > element is a semantic element, which gives the text it wraps around the role (or meaning) of "a top level heading on your page."
