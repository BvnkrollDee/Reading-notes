# Creating Paragraphs
I really like using Markdown

I think I'll use it to format all of my document from now on.

And, unless the paragraph is included in a list, there is no need to indent the paragraphs with spaces or tabs.

# Line Breaks
This is the first line.

And this is the second line.

# Adding Emphasis & Blockquotes
## Bold text
> Making text **Bold** isn't too complicated
>> neither is *Italicizing* words
>>> making words ***bold and italicized*** is also pretty simple with markdown
