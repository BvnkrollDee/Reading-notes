# ***JavaScript*** <hr>

- JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language with first-class functions. While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser environments also use it, such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat. JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles.

* JavaScript's dynamic capabilities include runtime object construction, variable parameter lists, function variables, dynamic script creation (via eval), object introspection (via for...in and Object utilities), and source-code recovery (JavaScript functions store their source text and can be retrieved through toString()).

- Do not confuse JavaScript with the Java programming language â€” JavaScript is not "Interpreted Java". Both "Java" and "JavaScript" are trademarks or registered trademarks of Oracle in the U.S. and other countries. However, the two programming languages have very different syntax, semantics, and use.

## <ins>**For Complete Beginners**</ins>

* Head over to our [Learning Area JavaScript topic](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript) if you want to learn JavaScript but have no previous experience with JavaScript or programming. The complete modules available there are as follows:

&nbsp;

## [JavaScript first steps](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps)

- Answers some fundamental questions such as "what is JavaScript?", "what does it look like?", and "what can it do?", along with discussing key JavaScript features such as variables, strings, numbers, and arrays.

&nbsp;

## [JavaScript building blocks](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks)

- Continues our coverage of JavaScript's key fundamental features, turning our attention to commonly-encountered types of code blocks such as conditional statements, loops, functions, and events.

&nbsp;

## [Introducing JavaScript objects](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects)

- The object-oriented nature of JavaScript is important to understand if you want to go further with your knowledge of the language and write more efficient code, therefore we've provided this module to help you.

&nbsp;

## [Asynchronous JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Asynchronous)

- Discusses asynchronous JavaScript, why it is important, and how it can be used to effectively handle potential blocking operations such as fetching resources from a server.

&nbsp;

## [Client-side web APIs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Client-side_web_APIs)

- Explores what APIs are, and how to use some of the most common APIs you'll come across often in your development work.

&nbsp;

# ***JavaScript Guide***

## [JavaScript Guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide)

- A much more detailed guide to the JavaScript language, aimed at those with previous programming experience either in JavaScript or another language.

&nbsp;

# ***Intermediate***

## [Understanding client-side JavaScript frameworks](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Client-side_JavaScript_frameworks)

- JavaScript frameworks are an essential part of modern front-end web development, providing developers with proven tools for building scalable, interactive web applications. This module gives you some fundamental background knowledge about how client-side frameworks work and how they fit into your toolset, before moving on to a series of tutorials covering some of today's most popular ones.

&nbsp;

## [JavaScript language overview](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Language_Overview)

- An overview of the basic syntax and semantics of JavaScript for those coming from other programming languages to get up to speed.


&nbsp;

## [JavaScript data structures](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures)

- Overview of available data structures in JavaScript.

&nbsp;

# Embed or Include

- You can either embed the JavaScript code directly inside the HTML file, or you can put a line in the HTML file that will include the external JavaScript file. In most cases the latter is recommended, but for our first examples, in order to make the whole thing work in a single file, we'll embed the JavaScript code inside some HTML.

- In order to do that we add the < script> opening and < /script > closing tags. Between the two we write our JavaScript code.

&nbsp;

# Input Output

- The very first thing we need to learn is how to interact with the JavaScript code running in the browse. There are a number of way JavaScript can display text for the user (output). The most simple one is by using the alert function:

&nbsp;

# Alert

-This will show a pop-up in the browser with the text. (You can click on Try! that will open the specific script in a separate window.) The alert() function is actually rarely used, but it is an easy way to show the use of JavaScript.
